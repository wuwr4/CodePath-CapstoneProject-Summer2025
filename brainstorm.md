1. Dining Hall Digital Menu (Final Idea)
- Students can browse what's currently being offered at the dining hall. Includes pictures and reviews posted by other students to provide diners with an honest opinion on each dish. Each dish is marked with a 5 star rating. AI companion can provide a brief overview of the dish based on reviews.

Mobile: Location settings would allow app to figure out where the user's closest dining hall is. Students also prefer mobile apps that they can easily open and use compared to websites.

Story: Would allow students to figure out what they want to eat at the dining hall and set a realistic expectation before they get there. Personal example: I saw what was for lunch one day and was excited, but the dish turned out to be disappointing because of inaccurate descriptions. It would have been nice to see a picture of what the actual dish was.

Market: Only students of my university would use this app. Can possibily format app to be a template that can be used by many different university/restuarants. They would just have to supply their own food descriptions and images.

Habit: A typical student that eats at the dining hall would probably check it a few times per day. They would be consumers most likely, unless there was an incentive to post reviews/pictures.

Scope: Would need real time access to the dining hall's menu, but would still be fun to create the UI and navigation for a mock app.


2. Snack Flavors Browser
- Users can browse all the different flavors of a type of snack and be directed to websites/retailers that sell them. Every snack will have a detailed view that lists nutrition facts, release date, country of origin, etc.

Mobile: Doesn't need to be an app. Would probably work better as a website since users would be viewing large amounts of data.

Story: People who use the app would probably just view as a source of information or archive(like Wikipedia).

Market: Niche market and user base. Only people who are interested in special snack flavors would seek this app out.

Habit: The average user would likely use this app when they're craving a snack. They would probably explore the different flavor options for awhile before becoming bored and logging off. 

Scope: Building the interface of this app would be quite feasible, since it would only be images and texts, but it would be difficult to find an API or alternative source to feed information about the snacks into the app without hardcoding data in.


3. Movie Ticket Editor
- Users can create their own movie ticket using a template that allows them to replicate a real Cinemark ticket stub. Text fields will ask the user for information about their movie and use that to create the ticket with the correct fonts and letter spacing. Users can then download the ticket and print it out.

Mobile: Doesn't need to be an app. Would probably work better as a website since printing a ticket is the intended outcome.

Story: People who use the app would probably find great value in it, since manually replicating a movie ticket is tedious.

Market: Very, very niche market and user base. Only people who enjoy collecting movie tickets would use this app. Otherwise, a regular person would not use this app.

Habit: The average user would only use this app maybe once or twice a week, depending on how often they watch movies. It's not an app where you log in and browse, it's a tool where you log off after you've done what you want to do.

Scope: It would be hard to figure out how to create an image with editable text fields. Building the other parts of this app without this feature would be less interesting, since it would just be prompting the user for input.


4. Social Media Platform for Recipes
- Users can share recipes with other users in an Instagram like app. All posts will follow a strict format to ensure that only recipes are posted. Users can opt to follow other users that have interesting recipes. Each recipe has a dedicated breakdown of sections for description, ingredients, and instructions. Photos and videos can be optionally included. Users can rate recipes and leave feedback. AI can be used to create posts so users don't have to spend too much time formatting their recipes to meet the post requirements.

5. Social Media Platform for Gamers to Reconnect
- Users can create a profile that lists their usernames across the different games they play. Users can then search for other users based on the username of a player they wish to reconnect with. (Only works if both users are on the platform and are actively searching for each other)

6. Social Media Platform for Voting
- Users can create polls with two options and allow other users to vote on the polls. Platform would support brackets style voting and ranked voting (ThisOrThat + Reddit)
