Overview

Description
ZotDining allows UCI's students to get accurate and honest, student backed opinions of the dining hall's meal options.

App Evaluation

Category: Social

Mobile: Location settings would allow app to figure out where the user's closest dining hall is. Students also prefer mobile apps that they can easily open and use compared to websites.

Story: Would allow students to figure out what they want to eat at the dining hall and set a realistic expectation before they get there. Personal example: I saw what was for lunch one day and was excited, but the dish turned out to be disappointing because of inaccurate descriptions. It would have been nice to see a picture of what the actual dish was.

Market: Only students of my university would use this app. Can possibily format app to be a template that can be used by many different university/restuarants. They would just have to supply their own food descriptions and images.

Habit: A typical student that eats at the dining hall would probably check it a few times per day. They would be consumers most likely, unless there was an incentive to post reviews/pictures.

Scope: Would need real time access to the dining hall's menu, but would still be fun to create the UI and navigation for a mock app.
